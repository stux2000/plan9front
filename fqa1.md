## 1.1 - What is 9front? ##
Plan9front (or 9front) is a fork of the [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9) operating system. The project was started to remedy a perceived lack of devoted development resources inside Bell Labs,`[citation needed]` and has accumulated various [fixes](http://code.google.com/p/plan9front/source/list) and [improvements](features.md).

This FQA specifically covers only the most recent release of 9front.

## 1.2 - On what systems does 9front run? ##
9front runs on the following platforms:

  * 386
  * amd64
  * arm

See: [FQA section 3.2 - Selecting Hardware](fqa3#3.2_-_Selecting_Hardware.md)

## 1.3 - Why might I want to use 9front? ##
New users frequently want to know whether 9front is superior to some other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely unanswerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on IRC or on a 9front mailing list.

Whether 9front is right for you is a question that only you can answer.

## 1.4 - Is 9front really free? ##
Yes.

The maintainers of 9front support the project largely from their own pockets. This includes the time spent programming for the project, equipment used, the network resources used to distribute 9front to you, and the time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug reports. The 9front developers are not independently wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment, and resources make a big difference.

## 1.9 - Can I use 9front as a desktop system? ##
This question is often asked in exactly this manner -- with no explanation of what the asker means by "desktop". The only person who can answer that question is you, as it depends on what your needs and expectations are.

## 1.10 - Why is/isn't ProductX included? ##
People often ask why a particular product is or isn't included with 9front. The answer is based on two things: the wishes of the developers and compatibility with the goals of the project. A product will not be included simply because it is "nifty."

A major consideration is the wishes of the developers. The 9front developers are the ultimate judges of what does and doesn't go into the project. Just because an application is "good" doesn't mean the 9front project wishes to devote the resources needed to maintaining it, or that they will share other's enthusiasm about its place in 9front.
